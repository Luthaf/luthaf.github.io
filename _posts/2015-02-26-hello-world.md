   Here is mine, as a starting point for this new blog.

So, here I am. Starting a programming blog. I've been told many time that this is a good idea, that writing on the net can only have benefits. Let's see what will append!

## Who am I?

I am known on the Interet with the pseudonyme of [Luthaf](https://github.com/Luthaf), and I am a french Master student in theoretical chemistry. I am also a scientist who enjoy programming, and likes making good, fun and clean code. My experience is built around two very oposite domains: web programming, and scientific programming.

As an other part of my life, I am also a musician, playing lot of random intruments from around the world, like a tin whistle, a Khene, an hammered dulcimer and a mandoline.

## Hello everyone !

Some programming languages I enjoy and I may write about:

```julia
#!/usr/bin/env julia

println("Hello from Julia!")
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello from Python!")
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   std::cout << "Hello from C++!" << std::endl;
   return 0;
}
```

```fortran
program hello
   implicit none
   write(*, *) "Hello from Fortran!"
end program
```

See you soon on this blog !
